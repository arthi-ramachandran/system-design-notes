# system-design-notes

Have you ever found yourself in a system design review and thought: “I’m not sure I fully understand what’s going on… am I missing something?”. 
If so, you’re not alone. Many TPMs experience a bit of imposter syndrome in design review meetings, especially when engineers dive 
into technical trade-offs, scaling strategies, or database choices. The good news that understanding in depth the system design fundamentals 
can give you the context to ask the right questions, anticipate technical risks, and connect technical decisions to business outcomes.

Here’s a curated list of software system design concepts that help TPMs feel confident in design discussions:
